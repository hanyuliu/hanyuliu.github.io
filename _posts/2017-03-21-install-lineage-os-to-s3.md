**[Lineage OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LineageOS)** is the successor of popular Android distribution, CyanogenMod. In this post, let's install Lineage OS on a Samsumg S3 phone to try this brand new OS published late last year.
### Root your device
Please refer this **[link](https://www.kingoapp.com/root-tutorials/how-to-root-galaxy-s3.htm)** to root yoour device.
### Install bootloader
Before install bootloader, you may need to unlock the bootloader. I have a Verizon S3, so I use this **[link](http://senp4i.com/how-to-unlock-the-bootloader-of-samsung-galaxy-s3)** to unlock first. After the bootloader is unlocked, you may procede to this **[link](http://teamw.in/project/twrp2/102/)** to install TWRP bootloader.
### Install Lineage OS and Google apps
OK, this the last step, please refer this **[link](http://www.lineageosrom.com/2016/12/rom-download-lineage-os-for-galaxy-s3.html)** to flash new OS to your device. If you want to install Google Play, please download **[Open GApps](http://opengapps.org/)** and refer its instructions to install it.
### Play around
Here are some photos of my S3 with Lineage OS:

After few days' usage, Lineage OS works really well on this device. Comparing to using S3's original OS, which is based on 4.1, I got longer battery life and more responsive UI. Seems Android really got a lot of improvements and optimizations since 4.1. After installed a new battery to my S3, which costs less than $10, I almost got a similar experience from current mid-range devices.
